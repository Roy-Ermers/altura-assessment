# Altura coding assessment

First install the requirements:

```bash
npm i
```

Then run the project:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## The task

The task is to recreate the [altura status page](https://status.altura.io). We already provided a few files and setup the project for you. If there is content in the file try to follow the design as close as possible. If there is no content in the file you can do as much as you please.

The use of other packages is allowed, but don't overdo it. We want to see your code, not the code of a package.
Also we want to see your own SCSS, so don't use a CSS framework like Bootstrap or Tailwind. Also please keep using typescript in this project.
